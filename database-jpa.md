This document outlines the core concepts related to databases, DBMS, SQL, ORM, JPA, and Spring Boot validations, including annotations and dependencies like Lombok.

ðŸ”¹ Database
A database is a structured repository where data related to your applicationâ€”such as users and productsâ€”is stored and managed.

Types of Databases
Relational (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

Non-Relational (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra)

ðŸ”¹ DBMS (Database Management System)
A DBMS is an interface between the user and the database, used to manage, retrieve, and manipulate data.

Common DBMS Examples:
MySQL

Oracle Database

SQL Server

MongoDB

Cassandra

ðŸ”¹ Key DBMS Terminologies
Table: Organizes data in a structured format (rows and columns).

Column: Represents a property/attribute of the table.

Row (Tuple/Record): A single record in a table.

ðŸ”¹ SQL (Structured Query Language)
Used to retrieve, manage, and update data in a relational database.

Enables interaction with the database using statements like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.

ðŸ”¹ ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
Converts classes into tables automatically.

Attributes in the class are mapped to columns in the table.

Developers do not need to manually write SQL queries for table creation.

ðŸ”¹ JPA (Java Persistence API)
An interface specification for accessing, persisting, and managing data between Java objects and a relational database.

Allows seamless interaction with the database through object-oriented code.

ðŸ”¹ Data Access Layer
Contains all the repository classes.

Acts as the medium between the service layer and the database.

ðŸ”¹ H2 Database
An open-source, in-memory relational database.

Written in Java.

Commonly used for testing and development purposes in Spring Boot applications.

ðŸ”¹ JPA Annotations
@Entity â†’ Maps a class to a table.

@Id â†’ Marks the primary key (unique identifier) of a table.

ðŸ”¹ Lombok
Lombok is a Java library used to reduce boilerplate code in your applications.

Common Lombok Annotations:
@Getter / @Setter â€“ Generates getters and setters automatically.

@NoArgsConstructor â€“ Generates a no-argument constructor.

@RequiredArgsConstructor â€“ Generates a constructor with required arguments.

@AllArgsConstructor â€“ Generates a constructor with all class fields.

@Data â€“ Shortcut for @Getter, @Setter, @ToString, @EqualsAndHashCode, and @RequiredArgsConstructor.

@Value â€“ Used for immutable classes.

@NonNull â€“ Ensures that the field is not null during object creation.

@Builder â€“ Provides the Builder pattern for object creation.

@Cleanup â€“ Ensures a resource is cleaned up automatically.

ðŸ”¹ Validation in Spring Boot
Validations help ensure the integrity and correctness of user input before processing.

Common Spring Boot Validation Annotations:
@NotNull â€“ Field must not be null.

@NotEmpty â€“ Field must not be null or empty.

@Size(min = x, max = y) â€“ Ensures the field length is within bounds.

@Email â€“ Ensures the field contains a valid email format.

@Min(value) / @Max(value) â€“ Sets numeric lower and upper bounds.
